# HC_Content_Degradation_for_produced_water

## Research Project with Dr. [Ehi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ehi-Oriausifo) Oria Usifo 

## Summary
Oil and gas exploration and production are two of the activities that potentially cause pollution and environmental damage. The largest waste generated from this activity is [produced water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Produced_water). Produced water contains hazardous pollutants of both organic and inorganic materials, so that the produced water of oil and gas production cannot be discharged directly to the environment. Uncontrolled discharge can lead to the environmental damage, killing the life of water and plants. The produced water needs to be handled and fulfil the quality standards before being discharged to the environment. 
The objectives of this research was; to determine the mix bacteria population, to isolate and characterize the hydrocarbon degrading bacteria, and to degrade the hydrocarbon content of produced water using the cultivated pure bacteria culture. 

## Scope and Methods
The pure bacteria cultured was grown and observed in oil agar medium was used as a bio-stimulant to degrade the hydrocarbons in the produced water sample. 
### Materials and Apparatus

The materials and apparatus used for this experiment include;
1.	Produced water sample collected from Warri Exploration site
2.	Rotary incubator shaker: a device used to glow and maintain bacteria or fungi cultures
3.	250ml separating glass funnels
4.	10ml pipette
5.	UV-Visible Spectrophotometer: used to measure the concentration of solutes in a solution by measuring the amount of light thatâ€Ÿs absorbed by the solution
6.	Cuvette
7.	Conical flask and beaker
8.	Microscope

# Results and Recommendation
The initial total petroleum hydrocarbon contents calculated in the produced water sample was found to **125.513mg/l**, after it incubation period of 15days using the pure bacteria culture the value was then calculated and found out to be **84.527mg/l**. After the incubation period of 15 days the biodegradable bacteria could only degrade about **32.655%** of the total hydrocarbon content present in the produced water sample. According to groups of researchers, mixed bacteria culture is more effective than pure bacteria culture and can give a maximum of 98% biodegradation. Although not 100% efficient, the pure bacteria culture isolates found in the produced water sample was able to degrade the hydrocarbon content in the produced water to some extent, it is therefore a bio-degrader.
